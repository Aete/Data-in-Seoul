# Data-in-Seoul
The repository is for processing open data of Seoul in a more user-friendly. In addition, I will upload jupyter notebook files which contain data visualization examples.<br />
Now, I am working with data of citizen's mobility (bus, subway, taxi and etc.).


## Part 1. Mobility

In this part, I will organize traffic data in Seoul by year and month.<br />
All the csv files I upload include the number of users and location information.<br />
I also will upload Jupyter notebook file which I coded for making csv files and data visualization works.
